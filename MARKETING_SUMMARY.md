## Why Document Sync?

### 🚀 **Never-Ending Documentation Drift is a Thing of the Past**

Stop the endless cycle of outdated documentation. Document Sync automatically keeps your project documentation current by syncing files in real-time. When developers update code or documentation, everyone in your organization instantly has access to the latest information—no manual updates, no version confusion, no outdated wikis.
